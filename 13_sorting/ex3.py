# Exercise 3: Bubble Sort
# Description: Implement bubble sort algorithm
# Terminology:
#   - Bubble Sort: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if in wrong order
#   - Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) worst/average, O(n) best (already sorted)
#   - Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place)
# Algorithm Steps:
#   1. Compare adjacent elements
#   2. Swap if they are in wrong order
#   3. Repeat until no swaps needed
# Example:
#   Input: [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]
#   Process:
#     Pass 1: [1, 4, 2, 5, 8]
#     Pass 2: [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
#   Output: [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
