# Exercise 1: Selection Sort
# Description: Implement selection sort algorithm
# Terminology:
#   - Selection Sort: Repeatedly finds minimum element and puts it at beginning
#   - Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) in all cases
#   - Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place)
# Algorithm Steps:
#   1. Find minimum element in unsorted portion
#   2. Swap with first unsorted position
#   3. Repeat for remaining unsorted portion
# Example:
#   Input: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
#   Process:
#     Pass 1: [11, 25, 12, 22, 64]
#     Pass 2: [11, 12, 25, 22, 64]
#     Pass 3: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
#   Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
